# User Personas Directory

This directory contains user personas for a project aimed at building a portfolio web app for an undergraduate computer science student. These personas are fictional characters representing key stakeholders, including the owner of the portfolio, the developers, and potential end users of the web app. The personas help define the app's requirements and user-centered design decisions.


## Purpose

The primary purpose of this directory is to provide software developers with a deeper insight into the intent and motivations of our users. By understanding these user personas, developers can make more informed decisions about feature development, user experience, and interface design.


## How to Use

1. **Review the Personas**: Familiarize yourself with the different user personas stored in this directory. Each persona includes demographic information, goals, challenges, and usage scenarios.
   
2. **Design Considerations**: Use these personas as a reference point when designing and implementing features. Consider how each persona would interact with the feature and what their needs might be.

3. **Feedback Loop**: Share your insights and feedback based on the personas with the team. If you identify any gaps or have suggestions for new personas, contribute your ideas to ensure the personas remain relevant and comprehensive.


## Structure

The user personas are organized into individual markdown files, each representing a different persona. These files provide details about the persona's background, goals, needs, and challenges. The structure is as follows:

- `owner.md`: Represents the primary user of the portfolio web app, the undergraduate student.
- `developer_1.md`: Represents the front-end developer working on the app.
- `developer_2.md`: Represents the back-end developer working on the app.
- `end_user_1.md`: Represents a potential employer viewing the portfolio.
- `end_user_2.md`: Represents a recruiter assessing the portfolio.
- `end_user_3.md`: Represents a fellow student or collaborator viewing the portfolio.


## Contributions

We encourage team members to contribute to this directory by updating existing personas or adding new ones. Ensure that all contributions maintain the integrity and purpose of the personas, and that they align with the needs and goals of the app’s stakeholders.

If you'd like to contribute, please submit a pull request (PR) with your proposed changes. When submitting a PR, make sure to:
- Clearly explain the updates or additions in the PR description.
- Ensure that your changes are consistent with the format and structure of the existing personas.
- Test any new personas for clarity and completeness.

All contributions will be reviewed before merging to ensure they align with the overall objectives of the project.


## Example Persona

Here's an example of what a user persona markdown file might look like:

### Name: Emily Richards
- **Role**: Potential Employer
- **Age**: 30  
- **Gender**: Female  
- **Location**: San Francisco, USA  
- **Industry**: Tech Recruiting

#### Goals and Motivations:
- Evaluate the student’s coding skills and project experience for a potential internship role.
- Look for evidence of problem-solving, technical proficiency, and initiative.

#### Challenges and Pain Points:
- Limited time to review portfolios.
- Struggles with cluttered or poorly organized portfolios, making it hard to quickly find key information.

#### Scenario:
Emily browses the student’s portfolio, easily navigating to projects and code samples. She appreciates the clean design, which allows her to quickly assess their skills and academic background. Within minutes, she finds relevant project examples and is able to move forward with the interview process.
