# User Personas Directory

This directory is dedicated to housing user personas for our project. These personas are fictional characters created based on our research to represent the different types of users that might interact with our product. They help us to better understand the needs, goals, and behaviors of our users.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this directory is to provide software developers with a deeper insight into the intent and motivations of our users. By understanding these user personas, developers can make more informed decisions about feature development, user experience, and interface design.

## How to Use

1. **Review the Personas**: Familiarize yourself with the different user personas stored in this directory. Each persona includes demographic information, goals, challenges, and usage scenarios.
   
2. **Design Considerations**: Use these personas as a reference point when designing and implementing features. Consider how each persona would interact with the feature and what their needs might be.

3. **Feedback Loop**: Share your insights and feedback based on the personas with the team. If you identify any gaps or have suggestions for new personas, contribute your ideas to ensure the personas remain relevant and comprehensive.

## Structure

The personas are organized into individual markdown files, each representing a unique user type. The filename convention follows the format: `persona_<name>.md`.

## Contributions

We encourage team members to contribute to this directory by updating existing personas or adding new ones. Ensure that all contributions maintain the integrity and purpose of the personas, and are backed by user research or data.
