# Markdown Quality Assurance (QA)

Welcome to the Markdown Quality Assurance (QA) guide for this repository! As a community of contributors, it's important to maintain consistent, high-quality markdown files. To help achieve this, we'll be using two command line tools: **Vale** and **markdownlint-cli**.

## Why Use Vale and markdownlint-cli?

- **Vale** is a powerful linter that checks for readability, consistency, and errors. It helps ensure that your markdown content is clear and polished.
- **markdownlint-cli** ensures that your markdown files adhere to best practices, such as proper heading structure, consistent use of lists, and correct syntax.

Both tools are essential for maintaining the quality of our documentation and markdown files in this repository.

## Steps to Ensure Quality Markdown

Follow these steps to ensure your markdown files meet the required standards before pushing them to the default branch.

### 1. Install Vale and markdownlint-cli

First, you need to install both tools on your local machine. You can do this easily via npm.

#### Install markdownlint-cli
```bash
